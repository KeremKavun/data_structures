# Data Structures (C)

A collection of data structures implementations i implemented through data structres course.

## Overview

This repository contains modular implementations of arrays, lists, trees, queues, stacks, graphs, and related utilities. Each module lives in its own directory and includes source, headers, and tests where applicable.

## Project Structure

The library is organized into specialized modules:

- `include/`: Public API headers.
- `src/`: Core implementation logic.
- `tests/`: Comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### Modules & API Reference

- **[Arrays](@ref ARRAYS)**: Contiguous memory wrappers and dynamic vectors (DynArrays).
- **[Linked Lists](@ref CircularLinkedList)**: Intrusive circular and linear linked structures.
- **[Trees](@ref TREES)**: Binary Trees, Heaps, AVL, and BST implementations.
- **[Queue](@ref QUEUE)**: FIFO containers (Linked and Array-based).
- **[Stack](@ref STACK)**: LIFO containers with stack-frame safety.
- **[Graphs](@ref GRAPHS)**: Adjacency-list representations for directed/unweighted graphs.
- **[HashStructs](@ref HASHS)**: High-performance lookup tables (HashSet s in progress).
- **[Utilities](@ref UTILS)**: Logging (@ref DEBUG), @ref OBJ_CONCEPT, and @ref ALLOC_CONCEPT.

## Development Philosophy

This project was built using AI extensively to discuss and implement professional architectural solutions:
- **Architecture**: Designed in collaboration with **Gemini**, focusing on professional C idioms, pointer safety, and modularity.
- **Quality Assurance**: Unit tests were generated by **Claude**, providing a rigorous outside-in verification of the API's edge cases.
- **Documentation**: Standardized using **Doxygen** to ensure the library is readable for both humans and machines.

## 🛠️ Building & Installation

The project uses a recursive `Makefile` system.

**Build libds.a:**
```sh
make all
```

## Tests

Each module typically provides unit tests in its `tests/` directory. Run the command below to run the test.

Example:

```sh
data_strucures$ make test_<module_name>
```

## Status

- Most core modules (arrays, linked lists, trees, queue, stack, graphs) are present with source and tests.
- `hashs/hash_set.h` is currently in progress to restorate the old code and not yet complete.
- Considering implementing skip lists, tries too.
